Generates random maps and paths. Allows user input to move around the world in each cardinal direction or by flying using f <x> <y>
Generates a new random map with connecting paths every time they move.
PokeCenters and PokeMarts are less likely to spawn the farther you get from the starting map.

Use "make" to compile the c file, then "./map_gen" to run the program.
